# Inventory-APIs

Created Backend application, where we have sample InventoryFile Details of various products of different suppliers.

APIs:
1. API to accept a CSV file and ingest the data into a db. You can take it that a new csv added will be of the same format.
2. Given a supplier id or name, list all the products that the supplier has with stock.
3. Accept a search param for the above filter based on the product name.
4. Accept a param for the above api, or create a new endpoint to only list out products that didnâ€™t yet expire for that supplier or list of suppliers.
